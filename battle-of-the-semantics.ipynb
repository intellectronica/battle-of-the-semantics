       "\n",
       "- **Political Leadership**: Robespierre was a leading member of the radical Montagnard faction and played a crucial role in the Committee of Public Safety, which effectively governed France during the Reign of Terror [Data: Reports (4, 7, 10, +more)].\n",
       "- **Reign of Terror**: He was instrumental in implementing the Reign of Terror, during which around 16,000 people were executed for counter-revolutionary activities, and another 40,000 may have been summarily executed or died awaiting trial [Data: Reports (7, 17, 20, +more)].\n",
       "- **Radical Reforms**: Robespierre supported and helped enact radical reforms, such as universal male suffrage and the Law of 22 Prairial, which expedited the trial and execution of perceived enemies of the revolution [Data: Reports (11, 30, +more)].\n",
       "- **Downfall and Execution**: His downfall came when he was perceived as a dictator by his peers. After refusing to name alleged conspirators against the Republic, he and his allies were arrested and executed on 28 July 1794, marking the end of the Reign of Terror [Data: Reports (1, 7, 29, +more)].\n",
       "\n",
       "Robespierre's legacy is complex; he is seen by some as a champion of revolutionary ideals and by others as a tyrant responsible for significant bloodshed."
