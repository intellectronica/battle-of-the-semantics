       "\n",

       "- **Reign of Terror**: He played a pivotal role during the Reign of Terror, a period marked by mass executions of perceived enemies of the revolution. Robespierre was instrumental in the establishment of the Committee of Public Safety, which oversaw these executions .\n",
       "- **Radical Reforms**: He proposed and supported radical reforms, including universal male suffrage. He also influenced the drafting of a new Constitution in 1793, which was ratified but not implemented due to the ongoing conflict .\n",
       "- **Downfall and Execution**: Robespierre's dominance ended with his arrest and execution on 28 July 1794, marking the end of the Reign of Terror. His death was followed by a wave of revenge killings against his supporters .\n",
       "\n",
       "Robespierre's legacy is complex; while he was a champion of the revolution's radical phase, his methods and the resulting bloodshed have made him a controversial historical figure."
