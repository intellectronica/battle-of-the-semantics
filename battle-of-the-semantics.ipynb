       "\n",
       "Maximilien Robespierre was a prominent and controversial figure during the French Revolution, known for his radical stances and leadership during the Reign of Terror. His actions and policies significantly influenced the course of the Revolution.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Key Points\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Political Leadership**: Robespierre was a leading member of the radical Montagnard faction and played a crucial role in the Committee of Public Safety, which became the de facto executive government during the Reign of Terror [Data: Reports (7, 111, 114, +more)].\n",
       "- **Reign of Terror**: Under his influence, the Law of 22 Prairial was enacted, which expedited the execution of \"enemies of the people\" and led to a significant increase in executions in Paris [Data: Reports (129, 132, 133, +more)]. Approximately 16,000 people were executed, and another 40,000 may have been summarily executed or died awaiting trial during this period [Data: Reports (118, 119)].\n",
       "- **Radical Reforms**: Robespierre supported radical reforms, including universal male suffrage and the suspension of the 1793 Constitution to maintain revolutionary control [Data: Reports (114, 130, +more)].\n",
       "- **Downfall and Execution**: His refusal to name alleged conspirators against the Republic led to his downfall. After a failed suicide attempt, Robespierre was arrested and executed on 28 July 1794, marking the end of the Reign of Terror [Data: Reports (131, 132, 133)].\n",
       "- **Legacy**: Despite his execution, some of his allies, like Paul Barras and Joseph Fouché, retained their positions and continued to influence French politics [Data: Reports (136, 137)].\n",
       "\n",
       "Robespierre's tenure was marked by his unwavering commitment to revolutionary ideals and his willingness to use extreme measures to achieve them. His leadership during the Reign of Terror remains one of the most debated aspects of the French Revolution."
